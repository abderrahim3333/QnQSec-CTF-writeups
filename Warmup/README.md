Challenge Description

A strange transmission was intercepted from deep space.
It sounds like random noise — but maybe there’s more than what you hear.


Approach

At first glance, the challenge file sounded like static noise. Since it was in the Steganography category and mentioned “random noise”, I suspected there might be hidden data inside the audio — possibly encoded visually in the spectrogram.

Tools Used

Sonic Visualizer — to visualize the frequency spectrum
